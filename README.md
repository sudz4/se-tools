# Screen Shot App

Headless Screen Capture Utility program.
Runs in the background and takes full monitor (screen) capture (silently).
Meant to be used by Solution Architects (SAs) and Pre-Sales Engineers (SEs) to assist with the creation of configuration ("config") docs and similar project deliverables as well as during requirements gatherwing workshops and during development.
In the absence of a conference bridge or recording error, the screen shot app also creates redundancy. And for some also usability, I have a maybe baseless theory that auto-screen capture and meeting note rationalization is more efficient that scrolling and buffering through zoom recordings.

## Libraries

The following libraries are used in the Screen Shot App:

- os
- time
- schedule
- subprocess

## Use Cases

There are several use cases for the Screen Shot App, including:

1. Using auto-captured screen shots later for config docs - documents to refer to if we forget how to do something or need to do an update later.
2. Capturing requirements in the absence of zoom recordings. We might also be able to make the case for it being more efficient to do screen capture. It can be tiring and time-consuming scrolling and buffering through recordings. For me and the reason that I created the program... well the reason I created it was for speed, accuracy, and efficiency. But, for me I am okay with 500-1000 screen shots taken at timestamped intervals during a meeting or a dev session. I am okay with that even if I only grab 3-5 of those screenshots to add to the formal project config doc folder (deliverable, probably with annotated notes, other project data from the project manager, etc.)

## Background, Notes, & Future Dev Ideas

The Screen Shot App was inspired by the creator's background in cyber security and the idea of malware programs that capture screenshots at intervals. When writing this program, the creator was also thinking about how when a user enters a password and then clicks "show password" to verify, the show password feature is supposed to be a promoted good feature, and not increase vulnerability.

As a Solution Architect or Pre-Sales Engineer, requirements gathering is an important part of the role(s). Not all meetings are recorded or someone forgets to record, leaving an SA or SE up late at night with no requirements, trying their best, educated guessing. The solution falls short of the client's expectations. Remember it is the SA / SE job to pull the requirements out of the Client and help them connect the business outcomes with technical solutions (the area where you are the expert).

In the future, the Screen Shot App could be enhanced with additional features, such as annotation tools or automatic categorization of screenshots based on content.

## Installation

To install the Screen Shot App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies (listed in the requirements.txt file or in the file itself). Still doing more dev. probably should create a requirements.txt file.
3. Run the app using the command `1.1_screen_capture_utility.py`.

## Usage

To use the Screen Shot App, follow these steps:

1. Launch the app using the command `1.1_screen_capture_utility.py`.
2. Specify the interval at which you want the app to capture screenshots.
3. The app will begin capturing screenshots at the specified interval.

## Additional Use Cases

Below are some additional use cases for the Screen Shot App, particularly for Solution Architects and Sales Engineers, as well as a few examples for other industries and an obscure use case.

### Solution Architects and Sales Engineers

1. **Demo sessions:** During demo sessions, the Screen Shot App can capture important moments, helping SAs and SEs review the session afterward to improve their presentation or identify areas that generated the most interest from the audience.
2. **Training and onboarding:** The Screen Shot App can be used to document internal training sessions or onboarding processes for new employees. This can help create a visual knowledge base for future reference, especially if the information is not documented elsewhere.

### Why Hackers Would Try To Install A HEADLESS APPLICATION UTILITY Like This One On Your Machine - Malicious Use of Screen Capture App for Social Engineering Attack

#### Disclaimer: Using a similar app for malicious purposes is not recommended or endorsed. However, for educational purposes, this is a hypothetical scenario involving a hacker using a screen capture app in a social engineering attack.

1. **Creating a malicious app**
The hacker would create a screen capture app with similar functionalities as the original app, but with added malicious code. This code could enable the hacker to secretly capture and transmit screenshots from the victim's computer to a remote server without the victim's knowledge.

2. **Crafting the lure**
The hacker would create a convincing phishing email, pretending to be from a reputable source, such as a software company or a trusted friend. The email would contain a link to download the malicious app, claiming it's a useful tool for productivity, gaming, or some other purpose.

3. **Exploiting user trust**
The hacker would send the phishing email to potential victims, hoping that they would trust the email's source, download the malicious app, and install it on their computer.

4. **Installation and execution**
Once the victim installs the malicious app, it would run in the background without any visible signs of its presence. The app would start capturing screenshots at predefined intervals or based on specific triggers, such as when the user enters sensitive information or visits particular websites.

5. **Exfiltration of data**
The captured screenshots would be sent to the hacker's remote server, potentially providing the hacker with sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial data, or personal details. The hacker could then use this information for various malicious purposes, including identity theft, financial fraud, or even corporate espionage.

6. **Maintaining persistence**
The malicious app could be designed to evade detection by antivirus software and persist on the victim's computer, allowing the hacker to continuously collect data over an extended period.

*Please note that this example is for educational purposes only and should not be used to engage in any illegal activities. Always be cautious when downloading apps and opening email attachments, and use a reputable antivirus software to protect your computer from threats.*

### Other Industries

1. **Education:** Teachers and instructors can use the Screen Shot App to capture images of their lessons or presentations, creating a visual summary that can be shared with students who missed the class or for review purposes.
2. **Software development:** During code reviews or bug tracking, developers can use the Screen Shot App to capture images of the codebase or application interface. This can help provide context and a visual reference

### Obscure Use Case

1. **Astronomy enthusiasts:** Amateur astronomers can use the Screen Shot App to capture images of celestial events (e.g., meteor showers, lunar eclipses) at specific intervals while using a telescope connected to a computer. This can help create a time-lapse or sequence of the event for further study or sharing with others in the astronomy community.

### Astronauts on the International Space Station

1. **Plant growth experiments:** Astronauts on the ISS can use the Screen Shot App to capture images of plants being grown in microgravity conditions. Regularly capturing images of the plants' growth progress can help researchers on Earth study the effects of microgravity on plant development and physiology.
* in other words taking screen captures of video?

### Real-life Alien use cases

1. **Alien anatomy documentation:** Researchers could use the Screen Shot App to capture images of an alien body during dissection, providing a visual record of the unique anatomical features discovered during the process. This could aid in the study of extraterrestrial biology and help researchers understand how the alien's body functions.

2. **Alien technology reverse-engineering:** If researchers were to find an advanced spaceship or technology belonging to the alien, they could use the Screen Shot App to capture images of the technology's components and mechanisms. This would help in the process of reverse-engineering, allowing scientists to study the technology's design and possibly develop new innovations based on the findings.

3. **Communication attempts:** In case researchers encounter a living alien and try to establish communication, they could use the Screen Shot App to capture images of any visual cues or symbols used by the alien during the communication attempts. These images could help linguists and scientists decode the alien's language or communication system.

4. **Habitat reconstruction:** If the alien's habitat were discovered, researchers could use the Screen Shot App to capture images of the environment, structures, and objects found within. This would provide valuable information about the alien's culture, lifestyle, and possibly the planet they originated from.

5. **Artifact analysis:** If artifacts or objects belonging to the alien culture were found, the Screen Shot App could be used to capture images of these items during the analysis process. This would help researchers document the artifacts' features, materials, and possible functions, contributing to the understanding of the alien civilization.
