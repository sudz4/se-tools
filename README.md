Use Cases
There are several use cases for the Screen Shot App, including:

Using auto-captured screen shots later for config docs - documents to refer to if we forget how to do something or need to do an update later.
Capturing requirements in the absence of zoom recordings. We might also be able to make the case for it being more efficient to do screen capture. It can be tiring and time-consuming scrolling and buffering through recordings. For me and the reason that I created the program... well the reason I created it was for speed, accuracy, and efficiency. But, for me I am okay with 500-1000 screen shots taken at timestamped intervals during a meeting or a dev session. I am okay with that even if I only grab 3-5 of those screenshots to add to the formal project config doc folder (deliverable, probably with annotated notes, other project data from the project manager, etc.)
Background, Notes, & Future Dev Ideas (templated)
The Screen Shot App was inspired by the creator's background in cyber security and the idea of malware programs that capture screenshots at intervals. When writing this program, the creator was also thinking about how when a user enters a password and then clicks "show password" to verify, the show password feature is supposed to be a promoted good feature, and not increase vulnerability.

As a Solution Architect or Pre-Sales Engineer, requirements gathering is an important part of the role(s). Not all meetings are recorded or someone forgets to record, leaving an SA or SE up late at night with no requirements, trying their best, educated guessing. The solution falls short of the client's expectations. Remember it is the SA / SE job to pull the requirements out of the Client and help them connect the business outcomes with technical solutions (the area where you are the expert).

In the future, the Screen Shot App could be enhanced with additional features, such as annotation tools or automatic categorization of screenshots based on content.
